# Contributing

We love contributors and We greatly value feedback and contributions from our community. Whether it's a new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we welcome your pull requests. Please submit any [issues] or [pull requests] through GitHub.

## Contributing Code

The list below are guidelines to use when submitting pull requests. These are the same set of guidelines that the core contributors use when submitting changes, and we ask the same of all community contributions as well:
* The SDK is released under [GPLv3 license]. Any code you submit will be released under that license.
* Code should follow pep 8, although if you are modifying an existing module, it is more important for the code to be consistent if there are any discrepancies.
* If you would like to implement support for a significant feature that is not yet available in the TicketGuardian Python SDK, please open an [issue] to discuss the feature request further.

## Reporting Issues

* Check to see if there's an existing issue/pull request for the bug/feature before opening a new one
* The ideal [issue] should contain:
    * A short description of the issue/feature request.
    * The steps to reproduce the issue.
    * The version of the SDK you are using.

## Vulnerabilities
* TL;DR: please report security issues by emailing security@ticketguardian.com
* General requests/bugs should follow the **Reporting Issues** section.
* Instead, if you believe you've found something in TicketGuardian Python SDK which has security implications, please send a description of the issue via email to security@ticketguardian.com. Mail sent to the address reaches our security team.
